/**
 * A struct for primary and secondary Vinyl indexes.
 *
 * Vinyl primary and secondary indexes work differently:
 *
 * - the primary index is fully covering (also known as
 *   "clustered" in MS SQL circles).
 *   It stores all tuple fields of the tuple coming from
 *   INSERT/REPLACE/UPDATE/DELETE operations. This index is
 *   the only place where the full tuple is stored.
 *
 * - a secondary index only stores parts participating in the
 *   secondary key, coalesced with parts of the primary key.
 *   Duplicate parts, i.e. identical parts of the primary and
 *   secondary key are only stored once. (@sa key_def_merge
 *   function). This reduces the disk and RAM space necessary to
 *   maintain a secondary index, but adds an extra look-up in the
 *   primary key for every fetched tuple.
 *
 * When a search in a secondary index is made, we first look up
 * the secondary index tuple, containing the primary key, and then
 * use this key to find the original tuple in the primary index.

 * While the primary index has only one key_def that is
 * used for validating and comparing tuples, secondary index needs
 * two:
 *
 * - the first one is defined by the user. It contains the key
 *   parts of the secondary key, as present in the original tuple.
 *   This is key_def.
 *
 * - the second one is used to fetch key parts of the secondary
 *   key, *augmented* with the parts of the primary key from the
 *   original tuple and compare secondary index tuples. These
 *   parts concatenated together construe the tuple of the
 *   secondary key, i.e. the tuple stored. This is key_def.
