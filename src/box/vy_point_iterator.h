 * and possibly one terminal statement (replace or delete). The iterator
 * sequentially scans txw, cache, mems and runs until a terminal statement is
 * met. After reading the slices the iterator checks that the list of mems
 * hasn't been changed and restarts if it is the case.
 * After the history is collected the iterator calculates resultant statement
 * and, if the result is the latest version of the key, adds it to cache.
